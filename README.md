- 🌱 I’m currently learning to better my Python skills. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- 🤩 Main skills: Java, C#, Game Development, and Web Design
- ✍️ Currently working on: An open source Google Chrome extension 

#### I apologize for the lack of complete repositories - I have many other projects on another laptop that I have not put up on here (but will soon), as I had previously only used GitHub in select situations during university. That has and is changing. 
  #### Give me some time and I'll blow your mind!
